# Control Parameter Inventory

**Status:** Active — aligned with the JSON control bridge (2025-11-02)

This note keeps a readable index of the control capabilities that DigitShowDST
exposes through the production JSON workflow files (`src/Control_File.cpp`
loader) and the legacy CFNUM helpers behind `src/DigitShowDSTDoc::Control_DA()`.
Use it to answer "which `uses` string do I need?" or "where does this number
land in the document?" and pair it with `control_specifications.md`, which
remains the authoritative mapping of field names, units, and defaults.

## How to read the inventory

- Everything the runtime executes becomes a **workflow step**. Today we persist
  those steps as JSON (`schemas/control_workflow.schema.json`); the same model
  will be serialised to YAML once the schema reboot lands.
- Legacy CFNUM routines already live behind the JSON bridge. When you see
  “workflow strategy” below, think `uses: ...` in JSON and the matching CFNUM
  branch in `Control_DA()`.
- Specimen dialogs are surfaced as strategies too. They still call into legacy
  UI code, but the JSON bridge can schedule them alongside scripted loading.
  - Note: Manual voltage passthrough (Control ID 1–14) was removed on
    2025-11-02; use scripted steps instead.

## Strategy families at a glance

| Legacy entry point  | Workflow `uses` value                                                | Notes                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CFNUM 0             | `no_control`                                                         | Motor off, outputs hold; step completes immediately.                                                       |
| CFNUM 1 / 2         | `monotonic_loading_constant_pressure` / `_constant_volume`           | Stress-controlled monotonic loading.                                                                       |
| CFNUM 3 / 4         | `cyclic_stress_loading_constant_pressure` / `_constant_volume`       | Stress/strain cyclic variants; constant-volume counterparts reuse the same helpers with volume lock flags. |
| CFNUM 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 | `creep_*`, `relaxation_*`                                            | Long holds with adaptive motor limits; duration handling still tied to legacy timers.                      |
| CFNUM 9 / 10        | `displacement_loading_constant_pressure` / `_constant_volume`        | Displacement targets with optional sigma hold.                                                             |
| CFNUM 11 / 12       | `cyclic_displacement_loading_constant_pressure` / `_constant_volume` | Pair of cyclic displacement routines with cycle counters.                                                  |
| CFNUM 13 / 14       | `acceleration_constant_pressure` / `_constant_volume`                | Motor acceleration ramps.                                                                                  |
| CFNUM 15            | `constant_tau_consolidation`                                         | Holds tau while ramping sigma; only ERR_Disp override is honoured.                                         |
| CFNUM 16            | `stress_path_loading_constant_pressure`                              | Linear stress path defined by start/end tau and sigma start plus slope.                                    |
| CFNUM 17 / 18       | `creep_constant_pressure_fast` / `_fast_ref`                         | Fast-response creep modes with reference tracking.                                                         |
| CFNUM 19            | `pre_consolidation`                                                  | Isotropic pre-consolidation controller, distinct from specimen state capture.                              |
| Specimen buttons    | `specimen_state_capture`                                             | Wraps `OnBUTTONBeConsol` / `OnBUTTONAfConsol`; resets LVDTs and updates specimen arrays.                   |
| Utility             | `wait`                                                               | Synthetic strategy for delays/manual approvals, implemented in the bridge.                                 |

For the definitive parameter dictionary (field names, units, ranges, optional
sensitivity overrides), see `control_specifications.md`. That document mirrors
the JSON schema and lists every `with` field that the loader accepts today.

## Implementation breadcrumbs

- **Loader:** `src/Control_File.cpp` parses the JSON file, validates against
  `schemas/control_workflow.schema.json`, and populates the legacy
  `CFNUM`/`CFPARA` arrays. Specimen capture steps may be injected as synthetic
  rows where needed.
- **Runtime:** `src/digitshow_operations.cpp::execute_control_step()` (Timer 2,
  extracted from DigitShowDSTDoc in PR #135) still performs the switch on
  `ControlDataNum`/`CFNUM`, invoking helpers in `src/control/` modules and
  writing to hardware. The JSON bridge shortens that switch by treating
  strategies uniformly but has not yet extracted the logic into standalone
  services.
- **Sensitivity overrides:** Optional indices 10–17 remain exposed for
  strategies that honour them. The JSON bridge only pushes values that differ
  from the global defaults held in `src/Sensitivity.hpp`.
- **Cycle counters:** The meaning of `cycle_count_param1/2` for cyclic
  strategies is unchanged from the legacy implementation. They feed the internal
  counters in `src/digitshow_operations.cpp::execute_control_step()` (extracted
  in PR #135); documentation updates will follow once we untangle that logic
  during strategy extraction.

## Guard rails and open items

- The inventory reflects **current behaviour** of the JSON bridge. When the
  strategy extraction (Phase 2) lands, expect the same names but new service
  boundaries (`ControlScheduler`, `ActuatorWriter`). Revisit this file once
  those types exist.
- Specimen state capture remains a thin wrapper around UI code. Until it is
  reimplemented as a pure service, expect side effects like dialog message boxes
  when running headless.

<!-- Manual voltage passthrough removed in 2025-11-02; guidance no longer applicable. -->

- Duration semantics for creep/relaxation/fast modes remain tied to
  `step_elapsed` and timer-driven checks. Verify with the helper implementation
  before assuming the JSON field enforces a hard stop.

## Where to deepen

- `control_mechanisms_overview.md` – narrative of Timer 2 flow and how JSON
  scripts interact with helpers.
- `control_logic_extraction_targets.md` – current shortlist for pulling
  strategies out of the document class.
- `ctl_to_yaml_migration.md` – legacy CTL conversion notes; still useful when
  comparing archived scripts during audits.

Keep this page synced with `control_specifications.md`: whenever a new `uses`
string or parameter ships, update both the schema and these descriptions in the
same change.
